MyPortal is a web-based school information system developed by Rowan Richards allowing teachers, pupils and parents to collaborate together and promote learning.

MyPortal provides school teams with the tools they always knew they needed but never had. Once implemented, MyPortal surprises them with how easy and quick it is to efficiently manage school life and drive improvement. Whether you want to add functionality alongside your existing school MIS or replace it entirely, MyPortal can help.
